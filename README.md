</h3>



- A quantum chemist by training, PhD alumnus of [Evangelista Lab](https://evangelistalab.org/).
- I worked on digital quantum simulation of molecules during my doctoral research, explore my dissertation ["Achieving quantum practicality via resource-efficient simulations of strongly correlated molecules on quantum computers"](https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/td96k398b?locale=it).
- Ex-scientific developer at [Schrodinger Inc](https://github.com/schrodinger), contributed to complex computational chemistry workflows for computer-aided drug discovery (FEP) and drug development (crystal structure prediction).
- My favorite part of software developement is writing unit tests and doing code reviews!
- While Python is my mother tongue, I am passionate about exploring low-level programming languages, including C++, Fortran, Go, Rust, to enhance the performance of my Python applications.
